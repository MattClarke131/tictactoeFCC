Shawn Notes
TicTacToe Game

HTML: A+
  it is weird to have tags within a button

CSS:
  using classes like ids. insead, try trusting the tree structure of html/css
  -Sass and Less exist. They are alternatives to CSS. for when you eventually tire of all the repetition

model JS
  checkgamestatus is difficult to understand. probably better to factor it into four distinct parts:
    checkVerticalVictory(colNum)
    checkHorizontalVictory(rowNum)
    checkForwardDiagonaolVictory()
    checkBackwardDiagonalVictory()
  setNumPlayers should be private since you have startTwoPlayerGame and startOnePlayerGame
  activePlayer API is wicked on point
  instead of implementing reset board in two different ways, just call resetBoard before returning tictaco, which has the same effect
    still need to declare the variables, just not assign their initial value
  "private methods" that are for internal use only should hav e their name be prefixed with _ as a convention meaning "private"
    expose the simplest possible API (but no simpler)

controller JS
  A+!
  level 3, with level 4 as i+1
  maybe ready for jQuery
